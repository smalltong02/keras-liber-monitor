# Introduction

HipsHook is a light-weight, and configurable x86/x64 Ring3 Hook project. You can edit the JSON files to add hooks of required Ring3 APIs, and to define the desired hook behaviour for each API. This document introduces how to use the JSON files to define and configure these behaviours.
