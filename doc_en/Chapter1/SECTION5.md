# 1.5 Sample Directory

Sample Directory contains samples for HipsHook tests, and the samples inside have the following feature:

* Have special arguments when calling certain APIs
* Will cause certain issues in HipsHook
* Is packed with certain types of packer
* Will call WMI APIs and be blocked by HipsHook

It is important to re-test on these samples before each release, to ensure that the issues encountered before will not exist in the new release.
